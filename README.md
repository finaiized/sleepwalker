sleepwalker
===========
**SleepWalkerEngine** contains the engine itself, such as:
  * basic camera
  * collision resolver
  * quadtree
  * scene manager
  * input manager

**Sleepwalker** contains the 'game'. It functions as a short demonstration of how to use various components of the engine.

Feel free to take bits and pieces as needed and use them in your own projects.
